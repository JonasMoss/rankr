\title{Confidence intervals for variants of Kendall's tau}
\usage{
tau_ci(
  x,
  y,
  n_boot = 1000,
  alternative = c("two_sided", "greater", "less"),
  alpha = 0.05,
  method = "BCa",
  variant = c("tau_d", "tau_a", "tau_b", "tau_c", "somers_d", "gk_gamma")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{numeric vectors of data values. x and y must have the same length.}

\item{n_boot}{number of bootstrap samples}

\item{alternative}{indicates the alternative hypothesis and must be one of
"two_sided", "greater" or "less". You can specify just the initial letter.
"greater" corresponds to positive association, "less" to negative
association.}

\item{alpha}{confidence level for the returned confidence interval.}

\item{method}{Method to used to calculate the confidence interval. Currently
only "BCa", the accelerated bootstrap, is supported.}
}
\value{
An interval containing the confidence limits.
